## üéØ Learning Objectives

These demo applications demonstrate:
- **Object-Oriented Programming** - Classes, objects, encapsulation
- **Data Structures** - ArrayList, object collections
- **User Input Handling** - Scanner class usage
- **Control Structures** - Loops, conditionals, switch statements
- **Exception Handling** - Input validation and error handling
- **Business Logic** - Real-world application scenarios

## üìù Code Structure

Both applications follow clean coding principles:
- **Modular Design** - Separate classes for data models
- **Clear Methods** - Single responsibility principle
- **User-Friendly Interface** - Console-based menu systems
- **Data Validation** - Input validation and error handling
- **Documentation** - Comprehensive comments and JavaDoc

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites:** Java JDK 8 or higher
2. **Compilation:** Use `javac` to compile the Java files
3. **Execution:** Use `java` to run the compiled classes
4. **Interaction:** Follow the on-screen menu prompts

These demo applications serve as excellent learning resources for understanding Java fundamentals and can be extended with additional features like file I/O, database integration, or GUI interfaces.
